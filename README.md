## About this Project
This is a browser-only HTML page that leverages the GoLang image2ascii library to create an ASCII stream right from your webcam!

This project is merely proof of concept with limited options showcasing a tool for the average user. Users have the option to convert their webcam input into a fun, animated ASCII gif!

Many, many more configuration options are availble considering the breadth of libraries used. Refer to the above links for more information.
